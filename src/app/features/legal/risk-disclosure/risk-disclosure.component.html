    <!-- Specific Risks -->
    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>4. Specific Risks of Forex Trading</h2>

      <h3>4.1 Market Risk</h3>
      <p>Currency prices can move rapidly and unpredictably due to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Economic data releases and news events</li>
        <li>Central bank policy decisions</li>
        <li>Geopolitical events and crises</li>
        <li>Market sentiment shifts</li>
        <li>Natural disasters and global pandemics</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These factors can cause sudden, significant losses in seconds or minutes.</p>

      <h3>4.2 Leverage Risk</h3>
      <div class="warning-box">
        <lucide-icon [img]="AlertTriangle" [size]="24"></lucide-icon>
        <div>
          <h4>Leverage Magnifies Everything</h4>
          <p>
            Forex brokers typically offer leverage ratios of 50:1, 100:1, or even higher. While leverage can multiply
            profits, it also multiplies losses:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>With 100:1 leverage:</strong> A 1% move against you = 100% loss of margin</li>
            <li>You can lose your entire account balance from a small market move</li>
            <li>Losses can exceed your initial deposit in extreme cases</li>
            <li>Higher leverage = higher risk of total account wipeout</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Never use maximum leverage available. Conservative traders use 10:1 or less.</strong></p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>4.3 Volatility Risk</h3>
      <p>
        Currency markets can experience extreme volatility, especially:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>During major economic announcements</li>
        <li>At market open/close times</li>
        <li>During low liquidity periods</li>
        <li>During geopolitical crises</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Volatility can trigger stop-losses, cause slippage, and create unexpected losses.</p>

      <h3>4.4 Liquidity Risk</h3>
      <p>
        While major currency pairs are typically liquid, you may experience:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Inability to exit positions at desired prices</li>
        <li>Slippage between your order price and execution price</li>
        <li>Wider spreads during off-hours or volatile periods</li>
        <li>Gaps in pricing (especially over weekends)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4.5 Counterparty Risk</h3>
      <p>
        You face risk that your forex broker may:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Become insolvent or go out of business</li>
        <li>Fail to honor withdrawals</li>
        <li>Experience technical failures</li>
        <li>Engage in fraudulent practices</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Only trade with regulated brokers and never invest more than you can afford to lose.</strong></p>

      <h3>4.6 Execution Risk</h3>
      <p>Technical issues can prevent you from managing your positions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Platform crashes or freezes</li>
        <li>Internet connection failures</li>
        <li>Order execution delays</li>
        <li>Failed stop-loss orders</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4.7 Psychological Risk</h3>
      <p>
        Trading can cause significant emotional and psychological stress:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fear, greed, and panic can lead to poor decisions</li>
        <li>Revenge trading after losses often compounds losses</li>
        <li>Addiction-like behavior and compulsive trading</li>
        <li>Impact on mental health, relationships, and sleep</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Financial Suitability -->
    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>6. Who Should NOT Trade Forex</h2>
      <p>
        Forex trading is <strong>NOT suitable</strong> for you if:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You cannot afford to lose the money you plan to invest</li>
        <li>You need these funds for essential expenses (rent, bills, food, education)</li>
        <li>You are in debt or struggling financially</li>
        <li>You have no emergency savings fund</li>
        <li>You lack the time to properly learn and practice</li>
        <li>You expect quick or guaranteed returns</li>
        <li>You are prone to impulsive or emotional decisions</li>
        <li>You have not practiced extensively on a demo account first</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="recommendation-box">
        <lucide-icon [img]="Shield" [size]="24"></lucide-icon>
        <p>
          <strong>Our Recommendation:</strong> Only trade with "risk capital" – money you can afford to lose entirely
          without affecting your lifestyle or financial obligations. Most professionals recommend risking no more than
          1-2% of your account on any single trade.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Demo Trading -->
    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>7. Demo Trading vs. Live Trading</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Important:</strong> Success in demo (simulated) trading does not guarantee success in live trading:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>No emotional pressure:</strong> Demo trading lacks the psychological stress of real money</li>
        <li><strong>Different execution:</strong> Fill prices and slippage may differ in live markets</li>
        <li><strong>Unrealistic discipline:</strong> Traders often take more risks with "fake" money</li>
        <li><strong>No real consequences:</strong> Losses in demo don't hurt, so bad habits aren't corrected</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>We strongly recommend:</strong> Practice on a demo account for at least 3-6 months with consistent
        profitability before risking real money. Even then, start with the smallest position sizes possible.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Regulatory -->
    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>8. Regulatory Considerations</h2>
      <p>
        Forex trading regulations vary by country. Some key points:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Not all forex brokers are regulated or legitimate</li>
        <li>Maximum leverage limits vary by jurisdiction (e.g., 30:1 in EU, 50:1 in US)</li>
        <li>Some countries restrict or prohibit forex trading for retail clients</li>
        <li>Tax treatment of forex gains/losses varies by location</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Always verify:</strong> (1) Forex trading is legal in your jurisdiction, (2) Your broker is properly
        regulated, (3) You understand tax implications of your trading activity.

          <strong>Trading forex is extremely risky. Most people lose money.</strong> Never trade with money you cannot

          If you are not comfortable with the possibility of losing your entire investment, <strong>do not trade
