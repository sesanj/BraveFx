      <p>
        We trust our students, but we must protect our platform from abuse. We reserve the right to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Deny refund requests that appear fraudulent or abusive</li>
        <li>Limit or revoke refund privileges for users with patterns of abuse</li>
        <li>Request additional information to verify refund requests</li>
        <li>Suspend or terminate accounts involved in refund fraud</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Examples of refund abuse include: repeatedly purchasing and refunding courses, sharing course content before

          <ul>
            <li>Result in immediate account suspension</li>
